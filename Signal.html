Please provide the best staff POC from your team for us to coordinate with over the next couple days and over the weekend. Thanks.

      "Team, I am out for the day doing an economic event in Michigan. But I think we are making a mistake. 3 percent of US trade runs through the Suez. 40 percent of European trade does. There is a real risk that the public doesn't understand this or why it's necessary. The strongest reason to do this is, as POTUS said, to send a message. I am not sure the president is aware how inconsistent this is with his message on Europe right now. There's a further risk that we see a moderate to severe spike in oil prices. I am willing to support the consensus of the team and keep these concerns to myself. But there is a strong argument for delaying this a month, doing the messaging work on why this matters, seeing where the economy is, etc.",
      "As we stated in the first PC, we have a fundamental decision of allowing the sea lanes to remain closed or to re-open them now or later. We are the only ones with the capability, unfortunately. From a messaging standpoint we absolutely add this to our list of horribles on why the Europeans must invest in their defense.",

I think messaging is going to be tough no matter what -- nobody knows who the Houthis are -- which is why we would need to stay focused on: (1) Biden failed and (2) Iran funded. Waiting a few weeks or a month does not fundamentally change the calculus. Two immediate risks on waiting: (1) this leaks, and we look indecisive; (2) Israel takes an action first -- or Gaza cease fire falls apart -- and we don't get to start this on our own terms. We can manage both. We are prepared to execute, and if I had final go-or-no-go vote, I believe we should. This is not about the Houthis. I see it as two things: (1) Restoring Freedom of Navigation, a core national interest; and (2) Reestablishing deterrence, which Biden cratered. But, we can easily pause. And if we do, I will do all we can to enforce 100% OPSEC. I welcome other thoughts.",
